## Usage

Open the website with [this link](https://32vache.github.io/cr-mastery-tracker). Enter your [player tag](https://www.touchtapplay.com/how-to-find-player-tag-in-clash-royale/) in the input box and the website will load your stats!

## Features

The website displays your overall progress on each tier of card mastery. 100% on a tier means you have completed all card masteries of this tier!

The reward progress section shows how much gems, coins and cards you collected from masteries and how much you can get by completing all the masteries! You can hover your mouse over the gems or gold count to see how much exactly there is left for you to obtain.
